# ASPIRE: Accesible Surgical robotics Platform for REsearch in surgical training, skill evaluation and autonomy
This repository will contain all the software and hardware components needed for developing an open-source surgical robotics platform ASPIRE using any 6-7 DOF serial manipulator, LCM, and dVIRK. The following repositories will contain all the necessary components.
1. ASPIRE Teleopeation framework: https://github.com/INSPIRELab-IITM/ASPIRE_Teleop
2. Lowcost Master (LCM) device hardware and software: https://github.com/INSPIRELab-IITM/LCM
3. daVinci Instrument Research Kit: https://github.com/INSPIRELab-IITM/dVIRK

*In the future, all these repositories will be added as submodules in this repository
